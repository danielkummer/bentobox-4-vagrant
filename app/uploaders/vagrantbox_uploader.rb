  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url

  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  #

  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb do
  #   process :scale => [50, 50]
  # end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(box)

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
